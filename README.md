üìÑ **Bookify ‚Äì Smart Library Management System**
**Phase 1: Core Library Operations**


## 1. Objective

To design and implement the core functionalities of the Bookify system, including book management, book assignment, automated notifications, penalty handling, and digital fine payment integration.

## 2. Phase 1 Functional Modules

### Step 1: Book Database Management

* Maintain a structured database of all books available in the library.
* Store details such as Book ID, Title, Author, Category, Availability Status, and Issue History.
* Enable the admin to add, update, delete, and view book records easily.
* Automatically update the book status to ‚ÄúIssued‚Äù or ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù based on transactions.

### Step 2: Book Assignment by Admin

* Admin can assign a book to a specific student from the admin panel.
* During assignment, the system records:

    * Student ID / Name
    * Book ID / Title
    * Issue Date
    * Due (Submission) Date
* Once assigned, the book‚Äôs status is updated to Issued, and the transaction is saved in the database.

### Step 3: Automated Notification System

* The system automatically sends email notifications to students on the following occasions:

    1. On Book Issue Day ‚Äì confirms book assignment with due date details.
    2. Three Days Before Due Date ‚Äì reminds students to return/renew the book.
    3. On Submission Day ‚Äì alerts students that the book is due today.

### Step 4: Overdue and Penalty Notification

* If a student fails to return the book on time, the system:

    * Calculates the penalty (fine) based on overdue days.
    * Sends repeated email notifications informing the student about their pending fine.
    * Keeps sending reminders until the fine is cleared or the book is returned.

### Step 5: Digital Fine Payment

* Students can pay their fines digitally through:

    * QR Code generated by the system, or
    * UPI ID provided by the library.
* Payment details are recorded in the system for verification.

### Step 6: Automatic Record Update

* Once the penalty is paid successfully:

    * The system automatically updates the student‚Äôs record.
    * The penalty entry is removed or marked as cleared.
    * The book‚Äôs status is reset to Available for future borrowing.
